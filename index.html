    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Self-Service Hexagonal API:</b> Designed, coordinated, and leaded the development
            (from conception to deployment) of an hexagonal FastAPI API to handle Tipti
            providers' catalogs, including operations such as product creation and updates, automated
            price webhooks, and Data democratization. Additionally, utilized a PUB/SUB
            system to handle over two million background messages per day to keep the system
            synchronized with Tipti's main databases in a functional manner utilizing advanced
            asynchronous logic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Stock Manager Consumer System:</b> Developed a centralized stock information manager
            Python automated batch process to asynchronously gather stock information from
            relevant stores' and process all necessary database changes in Tipti's system in a fast,
            maintainable, and scalable fashion. This software allowed the company to speed up
            its stock information synchronization from once every two hours to once every ten
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>AI-Enhanced Checkout Recommendations:</b> Leveraged generative artificial intelligence
            in conjunction with a Flask API to detect shopper intention in small orders and
            proceed to generate relevant recommendations that could enhance the shopping experience
            on checkout and increase potential upselling for the company. Additionally,
            developed a shared intention cache-like system to reduce costs and API response delays.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Gradient Boosted Churn Prediction Model:</b> Designed a real-world prediction model
            developed for Tipti S.A. using customer transaction data and captured events to predict
            whether frequent buyers were at risk of churning in order to take early action.
            This model employs a state-of-the-art XGBoost data mining model for feature selection,
            optimization, and training to ensure the best possible predictions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Data Mining models performance comparison in a substance abuse classification problem:</b>
            Performance and runtime comparison between <i>Random Forest</i> prediction
            models and <i>Multilayer Perecptron</i> prediction models. The time needed to tune each
            model's hyperparameters as well as time needed to train and solve the problem at
            hand was tallied and analized. Additionally, an alternative optimization method for
            <i>Random Forest</i> classifiers was proposed for the investigation.
